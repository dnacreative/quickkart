# quickcart

Ionic application built during GDG-Buffalo Hackathon 2015.

This application helps shoppers to find their items quickly.    
Here's how this runs:    
-The user will enter his list of items.       
-When the user enters the store he will scan a QR code at the entrance which will map each item on his list with the detailed location of the item in the store.
-(TODO : Use travelling salesman problem to suggest user a route)    
-The user can also share this list with his friends/roommates.   
-These friends will also see the same list of items.    
-This collaborative feature helps them keep track (in real time) of items being bought.
